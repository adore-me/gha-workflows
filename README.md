# AdoreMe GitHub Actions reusable workflows

## ‚ùì What is it?
This repository contains reusable workflows for GitHub Actions. 

If you want to find more about this you can check GitHub Actions [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows).

It's scope is to make it easier to create and share workflows by avoiding the need to write the same code over and over again in different app repositories.

## üîß How do I use it?
In your own GitHub Actions workflow, you can import the reusable workflows found in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) by referencing it like in the example below:
```yaml
name: 'CD'
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
    paths-ignore:
      - '...'
jobs:
  cd:
    uses: adore-me/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-cd.yaml@v0.0.22 # <-- Import the reusable workflow
    with:
      backup: true
      prod_gcp_project_id: SOME_PROJECT_ID
    secrets:
      QUAY_USER: ${{ QUAY_USER }}
      QUAY_PASSWORD: ${{ QUAY_PASSWORD }}
      GCR_CREDENTIALS: ${{ GCR_CREDENTIALS }}
```
