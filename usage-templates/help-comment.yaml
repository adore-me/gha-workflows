            **Versioning**
            By default, the versioning is configured to bump the `patch` version of the script.  
            â„¹ If you need to bump the `major` or `minor` version you should label this `PR` with either one of:
            - `release:major` 
            - `release:minor` 

            **Canary build**
            If you need to build a canary image from this `PR`, all you need to do is to post a comment (all params are optional and will be picked up from defaults):
            ```
            /canary [app-version=DEFAULT_TO_BRANCH_NAME] [php-image-tag=DEFAULT_TO_CI_CONFIG_YAML] [cache-routes=DEFAULTS_TO_FALSE]
            ```
            
            You will receive a reply with image details when it's done.
